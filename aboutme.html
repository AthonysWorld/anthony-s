<body><h1>Hello, nice to meet you</h1>
    <p><h3>Background</h3></p>
    <hr>
    <p>I am Anthony a Nigerian  Frontend developer and ux designer based in Nigeria, i have been practicing designs for a
        little over 9months, however i recently dived into programming. My skillset in designs spans from Ui designs to
        Ux designs, i'm currently a freelancer. Much of my designs have been targetted at designing and developing easy
        to use and self explanatory user experince.
 </p>
 <p>I obtained my Bachelors degree in Animal nutrition in the federal university of agriculture, Abeokuta. Along the line i
    discovered i had interests in building amaizing things. 
    My design journey started with me enrolling for the google Ux design course, and after almost 6months i completed it and
    was ready to explore the world with my newly acquired skill.
    After months of making beautiful designs i decided to improve my skillset by not just being able to design beautiful user
    experiences but also being able to bring them to life through programming, it was then i started taking courses on Udemy 
    and after months i enrolled in a physical bootcamp where i acquired more knowledge on Html, Css and Javascript and many more.
    Ever since then i have been working on improving my programming skills and also my design skills.</p>

    <p>I am passionate about designs and also bringing designs into full fuctionality with my programming skill, i believe
    learning never ends and i'm constantly on a mission to make life easier for users and also to improve my skillset.</p>
