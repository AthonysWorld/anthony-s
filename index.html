    I'm Anthony, a ux designer and frontend developer and i'm glad to have you here,
 as a ux designer and frontend dev i tend to build numerous designs, i build websites and web apps, i love
 my job because it allows me to not only be a problem solver but also it allows me to be creative.
 <p> My interest in Ux design started in my final year, in the year 2021 when i came across behance for the first
 time, i have always been interested in drawing and producing visually appealing things. After a while i decided 
to enroll for the google Ux design course and after 5months of online sessions i completed the course.
Over time i discovered that no matter how many designs i made i still could not bring them, to full functionality
without the intervention of a software developer. It was at this time i decided that i needed to be more than just
a designer, then i enrolled for an online fullstack course and after sometime i went to a physical bootcamp and
and focused on Frontend web development, it's been a busy few months or should i say year but my journey so far
has been enlightening and i hope for more adventures in the years to come in my newly found career path. </p>
